# ICS Pipeline Security with AI

This project implements an AI-driven security node for Industrial Control Systems (ICS), specifically targeting SCADA-based oil and gas pipeline monitoring.

## 🚀 Distributed Architecture
The system is divided into three main components:
1. **ESP32-S3 (PLC)**: Collects sensor data and controls actuators (In progress).
2. **Raspberry Pi 5 (Security Node)**: Hosts the MQTT broker, AI inference engine, and telemetry logger.
3. **Laptop (SCADA)**: Hosts the Node-RED HMI/Dashboard for real-time monitoring and control.

## 🛠 Setup Guides
- [🍓 Raspberry Pi Setup](1_SETUP_DOCS/RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md)
- [💻 Laptop SCADA Setup](1_SETUP_DOCS/LAPTOP_SCADA_SETUP.md)
- [🔒 MQTT Connection Guide](mqtt_connection_guide.md)

## 📊 Project Status
- **RPi Address**: `10.27.38.206` (SSH: naim@10.27.38.206, Password: 1234)
- **MQTT Broker**: Fully operational over TLS (Port 8883) with Auth.
- **AI Node**: Active on RPi, running in **Collection Mode** to gather training data.
- **SCADA**: Node-RED flows ready for deployment on laptop (localhost:1880).
- **Logging**: Real-time telemetry logging at `3_DATA_AND_ARTIFACTS/security_logs.csv`.

## 🎯 Quick Start After ESP32 Deployment

```bash
# 1. Test RPi connectivity
ssh naim@10.27.38.206

# 2. Check all services
sudo systemctl status mosquitto ics_ai_node ics_logger

# 3. View live logs
journalctl -u ics_ai_node -f

# 4. On laptop: Start Node-RED
node-red-pi --max-old-space-size=256

# 5. Access SCADA dashboard
# Open: http://localhost:1880/ui
```

## 🤖 AI Training (After 3 Days)

```bash
# SSH to RPi
ssh naim@10.27.38.206

# Train the model
cd /home/naim/pipeline_project
source venv/bin/activate
python3 2_CODE_AND_SCRIPTS/train_model.py

# Switch to monitor mode
# Edit /etc/systemd/system/ics_ai_node.service and add "monitor" argument
sudo systemctl restart ics_ai_node
```

## ⚙️ Service Management (on RPi)
```bash
# Check status
sudo systemctl status ics_ai_node ics_logger mosquitto

# Restart a service
sudo systemctl restart ics_ai_node

# View logs
journalctl -u ics_ai_node -f
journalctl -u ics_logger -f
```
